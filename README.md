# Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview
AtliQ Mart, a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, with plans to expand to other metro and Tier 1 cities in the next two years. However, service issues have led to the non-renewal of contracts by some key customers, largely due to challenges in timely and complete order deliveries. This project aims to create a supply chain analytics dashboard to monitor service levels daily and enable quick responses to delivery issues.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart faces customer churn due to gaps in service quality, with delays in delivery and incomplete orders being key contributors. To address these issues before expanding into new markets, AtliQ Mart's supply chain analytics team needs a solution to track:
- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full Delivery (OTIF%)**

These metrics are measured against target service levels set for each customer. The insights will support proactive management of delivery performance to improve customer retention.

## Project Goals
1. **Develop Key Metrics**: Calculate OT%, IF%, and OTIF% for each customer on a daily basis.
2. **Create a Dashboard**: Visualize metrics and insights to enable the supply chain team to monitor and act on delivery performance.
3. **Generate Actionable Insights**: Highlight performance trends and customer segmentation insights to prioritize improvements.

## Key Insights
- **Customer Segments**: Customers are classified into "Bulk Buyers," "High-Value Frequent Buyers," and "Steady Shoppers," each with different ordering patterns.
- **Customer At Risk**: Key customers like Lotus Mart and Cool Blue show frequent delays and low OTIF%, signaling potential churn risk.
- **Delivery Delays by Product**: High-demand products like dairy items (e.g., milk, curd) have significant delays, affecting overall customer satisfaction.
- **Monthly Performance Trends**: Delivery delays are highest in May, requiring seasonal performance analysis.

## Data Sources
1. **Customer Order Data**: To calculate metrics such as OT%, IF%, and OTIF%.
2. **Product and Inventory Data**: To analyze demand trends and product-specific delivery challenges.

## Technical Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python, SQL
- **Dashboard**: Power BI
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
